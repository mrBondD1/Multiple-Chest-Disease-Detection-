# Multiple-Chest-Disease-Detection

A Deep Learning model to detect 5 types of chest diseases from chest x-rays

### - This an experiment for my final year thesis. 👨‍💻
### - I have used tensorflow, keras, numpy, CNN architecture, softmax activation function, Adam optimizer etc. 🛠
### - This model can detect five types of chest diseases with 90% accuracy. ✌
